# smarthome-compose
Inspired by https://github.com/henfri/docker

This is a docker-compose file with required config directories for running:
- smarthome-ng
- smartvisu
- knxd

Currently not running (but originally included in henfri's compose file):

- grafana

To run this, you will need git and docker-compose.
